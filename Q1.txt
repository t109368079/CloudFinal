1. Linear Regression: A fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data points, aiming to predict future outcomes or understand the correlation between variables.
2. Random Forest: A versatile ensemble learning method in machine learning, employing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of individual trees, known for its robustness, scalability, and capability to handle high-dimensional data and complex interactions.
3. Gradient Boosting: A powerful machine learning technique that builds predictive models by sequentially adding weak learners (typically decision trees) in a manner that corrects errors made by preceding models, with each subsequent model focusing on the residuals of the previous one, resulting in strong predictive performance and often used in various applications like regression, classification, and ranking tasks.

Considering the problem statement, where household attributes like house size and income range are provided, a tree-based model such as random forest appears to be the most suitable choice. Given that the data attributes are categorical rather than continuously numerical, linear regression might not be the most appropriate fit for addressing this issue.
Unlike linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables, tree-based models can capture complex interactions and patterns in the data without requiring explicit feature engineering. Additionally, tree-based models are robust to outliers and can handle mixed data types, including both categorical and numerical features, more effectively.
